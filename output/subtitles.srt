00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Imagine… if all the world&#39;s knowledge were confined to one place… Thousands of years ago, in the Egyptian city of Alexandria, there was a place we now call the Library of Alexandria

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It wasn&#39;t just a library, it was the world&#39;s first knowledge center

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Here, there was science, astronomy, mathematics, medicine, and the knowledge that could propel humanity forward for centuries

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Every ship that arrived in Alexandria had its books confiscated so they could be copied… and the originals were kept in the library

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
But then… one day… everything changed

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Was it a fire? Or was the knowledge deliberately destroyed? No one knows the truth even today

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
All we know is that the most precious knowledge in human history was lost forever

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Imagine… if that library still existed today, what would our world be like? Mind Dose — where history forces you to think
